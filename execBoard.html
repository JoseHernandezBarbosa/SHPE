                    Hello! My name is Joshua De La Cruz, and I am an up and coming Junior at Dartmouth College. I am majoring in 
                    Engineering Sciences with a Concentration in Mechanical Engineering and a minor in Psychology. I am heavily 
                    involved in Thayer having worked under Professor Halter’s FYRE Image Segmentation internship, serving as a student 
                    assistant for Thayer’s Career Services, and recently working as a Dartmouth Emerging Engineers tutor. Outside of 
                    Thayer, I enjoy pickup soccer games and long boarding across campus. I am a member of the FGLI community and 
                    often take part in my housing community’s outings as well.

                    Hi! My name is Ian and I am a rising junior majoring in Engineering Sciences, possibly a concentration in 
                    Mechanical. I am involved in the Snowboarding club and have been a part of numerous other groups such 
                    as the Rugby Club. During my free time I enjoy skateboarding, meditating, and making beats. I 
                    am currently a research assistant at the Space Medicine Innovations lab down at the Dartmouth-Hitchcock 
                    Medical Center. I also work with MATLAB coding and hardware testing.

                    My name is Jose Hernandez and I am a rising junior majoring in Computer Science. This summer I will be interning 
                    at Google as a sowftare engineering intern working on their Google Voice app. This fall on campus I will be joing professor Zhou's
                    research project on Noninvasive Glucose Testing. I also love teaching and have previously been a teaching assistant for 
                    Intro to Computer Science. On my free time I love going on runs, playing pick up soccer, and trying out new foods!

                    Hi everyone! My name is Ravin Anderson and I am a rising sophomore hoping to major in computer science 
                    and mathematical data science. I would love to work as a software engineer one day as a backend developer. 
                    I’m a videographer for the Dartmouth College Fund and I’m a Computer Science Instructor for Juni Learning. I’m 
                    involved with Dartmouth’s FGLI network, West House leadership, and the Men’s Ultimate Frisbee team. In my free time, 
                    you can catch me watching Netflix, listening to some classic rock on my Alexa to the annoyance of my floor, or exploring 
                    the Upper Valley. If you’re ever thinking about CS, feel free to hit me up. Go Big Green!

                    My name is Joselyn, and I am currently a senior majoring in engineering sciences with 
                    a concentration in computer engineering. On campus, I have worked as research assistant 
                    for Professor Van Citters in identifying materials for autonomous robotic testing and in analyzing 
                    different knee implant models. I served as teacher assistant for ENGS20, an introductory C and MATLAB 
                    course. I have also participated in NASA's L'SPACE Academy as a Mission Concept Academy Scholar. My 
                    interest in both computer science and electrical engineering led me to be a Formal Verification Intern 
                    at Intel and a Processor and Chip Design Intern at IBM. As a first-generation, low-income college student, 
                    I enjoy mentoring first year engineering students of similar backgrounds through SHPE as well as the First 
                    Year Enrichment Program (FYSEP).
