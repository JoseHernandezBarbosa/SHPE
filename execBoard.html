                    Hello! My name is Joshua De La Cruz, and I am an up and coming Junior at Dartmouth College. I am majoring in 
                    Engineering Sciences with a Concentration in Mechanical Engineering and a minor in Psychology. I am heavily 
                    involved in Thayer having worked under Professor Halter’s FYRE Image Segmentation internship, serving as a student 
                    assistant for Thayer’s Career Services, and recently working as a Dartmouth Emerging Engineers tutor. Outside of 
                    Thayer, I enjoy pickup soccer games and long boarding across campus. I am a member of the FGLI community and 
                    often take part in my housing community’s outings as well.

                    Hi! My name is Ian and I am a rising junior majoring in Engineering Sciences, possibly a concentration in 
                    Mechanical. I am involved in the Snowboarding club and have been a part of numerous other groups such 
                    as the Rugby Club. During my free time I enjoy skateboarding, meditating, and making beats. I 
                    am currently a research assistant at the Space Medicine Innovations lab down at the Dartmouth-Hitchcock 
                    Medical Center. I also work with MATLAB coding and hardware testing.

                    My name is Emily! I am a junior pursuing a degree in Engineering Sciences with a modified major in Earth Sciences 
                    and a minor in Environmental Sciences. I am particularly interested in studying geophysical fluid dynamics and 
                    climate science. I have experience conducting field research in Utqiagvik, Alaska, collecting and analyzing ice 
                    core samples to quantify the impact of microplastics in the polar marine ecosystem, constructing a comparative 
                    analysis of Life Cycle Assessments for commercial products, and analyzing and designing new climate models that 
                    improve projections of freshwater availability in drought-risk regions. My most recent research project is working 
                    to numerically analyze ice flow over subglacial valleys and determine the critical point at which Moffatt eddies form. 
                    These experiences have influenced my passion for atmospheric and ocean research and I hope to continue conducting 
                    research like this post-Dartmouth. Outside of academics, I am a part of the Dartmouth Triathlon Team and have competed 
                    in a number of triathlon races, including two half-Ironmans.

                    My name is Jose Hernandez and I am a rising sophomore hoping to major in Engineering Sciences with a 
                    possible concentration in biology or computer science. I am very interested in the field of immunology 
                    and the study of pathogens. I have worked as a Teachers Assistant for Intro to Computer Science at Dartmouth 
                    College as well as participated in a computer science fellowship for a marketing company, Red Ventures. 
                    I am also involved with Dartmouth’s first-gen network and the Latin American and Caribbean council. On my 
                    free time I love going on runs, playing pick up soccer, and drinking coffee.

                    My name is Brygitte De La Cruz. I am currently a junior majoring in Biological Engineering, 
                    originally interesting in Environmental Engineering. Back home, I helped start the first annual Climate 
                    Awareness march. I interned in my home town at the Sun Valley Institute and worked with leading conservation 
                    and sustainability organizations. Once I got to Dartmouth, I fell in love with biological sciences. My sophomore 
                    year, I was selected to be part of the Dartmouth Presidential Scholars Research Program. I worked with Professor 
                    Zi Chen on his “Embryonic Brain Development” and his “Buckling and Post-buckling of Thin Elastic Rod Embedded in 
                    Elastic Medium” research projects. Soon I will be working as an intern at Idaho Biotech to help produce primary 
                    and secondary antibodies, as well as study cell-fusion with cancer cells. At the moment, I am also enjoying my 
                    job as a TA for Thayer. Outside the workplace and classroom, I am a powerlifter. My passion for fitness stems 
                    from my passion for health, which stems from my appreciation of the natural environment.

                    I am a rising junior majoring pursuing a Bachelor of Arts in Engineering Sciences with a possible 
                    concentration in Mechanical or Environmental Engineering fields. Being from Queens, New York, engineering 
                    first sparked my interest while training in the Grip and Electric cohort at the Academy for Careers in TV and 
                    Film where I served as a gaffer for student projects. At Dartmouth, my extracurriculars include House Manager of 
                    the Tabard Co-ed Society and Co Project Leader of Dartmouth Humanitarian Engineering’s longest running Compost 
                    Tea Project. In my free time, I enjoy learning new languages, skateboarding, and making drinks as a barista on 
                    the on campus Starbucks Cafe. My career interests include urban housing development, transportation systems, 
                    and sustainable design. I seek to pursue a fifth year of study under the Bachelor of Engineering Program at the 
                    Thayer School for Engineering as well as a minor in Hispanic and Lusophone Studies.
